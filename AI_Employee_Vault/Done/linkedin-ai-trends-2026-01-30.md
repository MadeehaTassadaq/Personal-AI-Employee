2026: The year AI gets real.

After years of hype, we're finally seeing AI move from flashy demos to practical impact. Here's what's actually changing:

From Big to Small: Smaller, task-focused AI models are delivering 10-30x better efficiency than their massive counterparts. The new Falcon-H1R 7B performs like models 7x its size.

From Tool to Teammate: AI is no longer just answering questions - it's orchestrating workflows, connecting data across departments, and moving projects from idea to completion.

From Automation to Autonomy: Agentic AI is projected to grow from $5.2B to $200B by 2034. These systems don't just assist - they make decisions and execute complex tasks independently.

The winners in 2026 won't be those with the biggest AI - they'll be those who deploy the RIGHT AI for the right task.

What AI implementation has made the biggest difference in your work this year?
